This post provides a brief tour of the pages of the Mandelbulb3D Animation Copilot.

**Head Area**

Regardless of which page is selected and active, the top of the Copilot window contains a variety of functions and information concerning the currently selected animation project. In this head area you will find the following:

1. Buttons for creating, updating and deleting projects
2. Entryfields for the project's name and notes
3. Entryfields for the location of the Mandelbulb3D parameter (m3p) and animation (m3a) files
4. The current total frame count calculated from the keyframe quantity
5. Entryfields for the Sliding/Walking count and the Looking/Rolling values from the Mandelbulb application
6. An entryfield for the Frames Between value from the Mandelbulb application
7. Calculations of the estimated length of your animation based on the keyframe quantity
8. An entryfield for the Far Plane value from the Mandelbulb application that serves as a visual reminder

**Main Page**

The Main page is where the movement actions of keyframes are recorded and listed in the "Keyframe Stack". The Main Page provides a variety of keyframe related functions, such as capturing and managing keyframes. The Main page also hosts the "Restore Point" feature that allows you to quickly revert to an earlier keyframe point.

**Move Designer Page**

The Move Designer page provides the ability to create and edit movement sequences that can be applied to your animation sequence from the Main page. This gives you the ability to create and store movement sequences to be used at a future time while you are using the Copilot to create Mandelbulb3D animations.

**Utilities Page**

The Utilities page hosts a couple features that help optimize your experience with the Copilot. For example, you can quickly create a sample project with sample keyframes that you can review and modify without risking an actual Mandelbulb animation project. This page also helps you understand how to configure the JoyToKey key mapper, which is essential for using the Copilot. As additional utilities are developed, they will be included on this page.

**Mandelbulb3D Library Page**

The Mandelbulb3D Library page is reserved for future features that will help you record detailed information about your Mandelbulb3D projects, including such information as screenshots of your projects, parameter sets of your Mandelbulb projects and so on. The Library will be developed and released in the future.

**Admin Page**

The Admin page hosts database back-up and restore features. *Please be sure to periodically back-up your Copilot database.*

The Admin page also allows you to completely clear all records from your Copilot's database, which you should do with caution. In addition, the Admin page hosts an error log that captures program errors should they occur, that can then be forwarded to the Copilot author for investigation. Note that the error log does not capture any errors that may occur with the Mandelbulb3D application itself - only Copilot errors should they occur.

**About Page**

The About page hosts reading panels for both the Readme and License documents, which are also included as readable files in the installation folder of the Copilot.
