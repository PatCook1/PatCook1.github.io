The Mandelbulb3D Animation Copilot is coming to Github soon!

The Mandelbulb3D Animation Copilot facilitates creating Mandelbulb3D animations by mapping a game controller or keyboard keys to the Mandelbulb3D Navigator movement keys and recording those keyframe movements to a local database.

This Copilot also automates keyframe creation with pre-designed move sequences and keyframe replication features.

This Copilot facilitates reverting to earlier keyframes as well as modifying keyframe actions in the event that a Mandelbulb3D animation keyframe sequence needs to be corrected.

The various features of the Mandelbulb3D Animation Copilot facilitate creating Mandelbulb3D animations that are complex in movement as well as longer.

The Copilot was developed to address the difficulty of creating long or or complex animation sequences with the Mandelbulb3D fractal generator. The challenge is not having the movement of each keyframe recorded to be able to keep track of the movements of previous keyframes. The Copilot places all of the movements of each keyframe into a local database to facilitate subsequent keyframing.

This Windows Winforms application is developed, and managed, by Patrick C. Cook. The Copilot is being prepared for realase via Github as open source software where you will be able to download and use it for your own Mandelbulb3D animation work.
