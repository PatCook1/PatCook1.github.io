The Mandelbulb3D Animation Copilot is coming to Github soon!

The **Mandelbulb3D Animation Copilot** facilitates creating [Mandelbulb3D](https://mb3d.overwhale.com/) animations by mapping a game controller or the keys of a standard PC keyboard to the Mandelbulb3D application's Navigator step and angle keys and recording those keyframe movements to a local database. This provides the animation creator with a record of all of the keyframe movements of an animation project, which in turn facilitates complex or long animation sequences. The premise of the Copilot is to help the animation creator keep track of the movements of previous keyframes to facilitate coordinating  long or complex animation sequences, which the Mandelbulb3D application itself does not provide.

The Copilot also automates keyframe movements with pre-designed move sequences and keyframe replication features. This provides the animation creator sets of move sequences that are stored in a local database that can be run simply by selecting from a list. This feature assures consistent move sequences, often of which are repetitive.

Because all keyframe movements are stored in a local database, the Copilot also facilitates reverting to earlier keyframes as well as modifying keyframe actions in the event that a Mandelbulb3D animation keyframe sequence needs to be corrected. This saves the animation creator from having to start the animation creation over.

As can be seen, the **Mandelbulb3D Animation Copilot** facilitates making long animations or animations that involve complex movements such as turns, sweeps, reversals and so forth. By storing keyframe movements in a local database the animation creator can prepare an animation faster, with smoother movement flow and less (or no) movement mistakes that would require difficult keyframe repairs or a complete re-start of the animation sequence. The Copilot makes creating animations much easier than the Mandelbulb3D application alone, allowing the creative potential of the Mandelbulb3D application to extend to longer and more complex animations.

This Windows Winforms .NET application is developed, and the open source project managed, by Patrick C. Cook who has been creating with the [Mandelbulb3D](https://mb3d.overwhale.com/) fractal generator since 2017. With his decades-long background as a professional software developer, Pat set out to address his intention to create longer and more complex animations with the Mandelbulb3D fractal generator. One such animation using the Copilot is [Tomb of the Ancients]( https://youtu.be/f_5J9lWgyiU) that involves 104 keyframes and over 24,000 frames. Keyframing the animation sequence for 'Tomb of the Ancients' took about 50 minutes.

The Copilot is being readied for realase via Github as open source software where you will be able to download and use it for your own Mandelbulb3D animation work.
