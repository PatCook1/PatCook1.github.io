This article provides instructions for installing the **Mandelbulb3D Animation Copilot** on your Windows 10 or 11 desktop or laptop.

**Requisites for using the Copilot**

1. The Mandelbulb3D fractal generator (<a href="https://mb3d.overwhale.com/" target="_blank">mb3d.overwhale.com</a>)
2. The JoyToKey key mapping application (<a href="https://joytokey.net/en" target="_blank">joytokey.com</a>)
3. A game controller is optional but recommended

Requisite Notes:

1. The Copilot is a helper tool-set for the Mandelbulb3D fractal generator. As such, the Copilot has no useful purpose without the Mandelbulb3D fractal generator installed and running.
2. The Copilot records animation movements to its local database. Therefore, it must control animation movements in order to capture those movements, encode them and store them into its database. Capturing animation movements is done with a key mapper that translates the buttons of a game controller to the keys that the Mandelbulb3D dractal generator expects for animation movements. The Copilot uses the JoyToKey key mapper for mapping keys.
3. A game controller, such as an xBox game controller, is an excellent method of providing a more natural control of animation movements. Using a game controller with the Copilot is optional, but highly recommended. Alternatively, the standard PC or laptop keyboard can be used to input animation movements that the Copilot will capture and record to its database.

**Installing the Copilot**

The Mandelbulb3D Animation Copilot is a Windows only application that can be installed on Windows 10 or Windows 11 operating systems. The Copilot will not install on Mac, Linux, Android or iOS devices.

To install the Copilot after downloading it, double-click the setup.exe file and follow the installation prompts. During installation you will be given the opportunity to read the README file and the GNU open-source license.

During installation, the installer may install the .NET 8.0 runtime if not already installed on your PC or laptop. This is a software library from Microsoft that allows applications written with .NET technology to run, such as the Copilot. During installation the .NET library is downloaded directly from Microsoft.

When the installation has completed, navigate to the app in your Windows Start Menu and select the Mandelbulb3D Animation Copilot icon.

If the Mandelbulb3D fractal generator is not running a message will remind you that it must be installed and running to use the Copilot.

If the JoyToKey key mapper app is not installed and running a message will remind you that it must be installed and running to use the Copilot.

If the Mandelbulb3D fractal generator and/or the JoyToKey apps are not installed and running, those apps will need to be downloaded and installed before the Copilot will be useful. You can obtain apps as follows:

1. Download the Mandelbulb3D fractal generator from <a href="https://mb3d.overwhale.com/" target="_blank">mb3d.overwhale.com</a>
2. Download the JoyToKey key mapper from <a href="https://joytokey.net/en" target="_blank">joytokey.com</a>

If the Mandelbulb3D fractal generator and the JoyToKey apps are running, the Copilot will be ready for use.

The Mandelbulb3D Animation Copilot and its database install directly on a PC or laptop. The Copilot does not connect to an on-line service and does not transmit any data to an online service or database. Also, the Copilot does not check for updates - you will need to periodically check for updates.

The Copilot is an open-source Windows application licensed under the GNU v3 open-source license - the Author requires no fee or cost to obtain and use the Copilot.

The Copilot in under ongoing development and will have its features modified over time. The Author and Project Manager has taken reasonable steps to assure that the code files are free or viruses and malware and that the application will perform as expected. However, the Author makes no warranty that the Copilot will perform as intended. Due to its active development, the Copilot should not be used for commercial purposes, although the GNU open-source license permits commercial use.

Thank you for your interest in the Mandelbulb3D Animation Copilot!
