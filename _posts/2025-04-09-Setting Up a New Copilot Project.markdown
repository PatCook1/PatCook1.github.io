This post describes the steps for setting up a new Copilot project.

Keep in mind that the requisites for using the Copilot must be fulfilled before the Copilot is useful.

1. The Copilot application was successfully installed and is running.
2. The Mandelbulb3D fractal generator was installed and is running (<a href="https://mb3d.overwhale.com/" target="_blank">mb3d.overwhale.com</a>)
3. The JoyToKey key mapping application was installed and is running (<a href="https://joytokey.net/en" target="_blank">joytokey.com</a>)
4. The JoyToKey key mapping application must have the configuration file "MB3D_JoyToKey.cfg" loaded (that file is found in the Copilot installation folder).
5. A game controller is connected to your PC or laptop.

Note: A game controller is optional but recommended. This post will assume you are using a game controller.

The Copilot is a animation helper that assists with navigation through the Mandelbulb3D graphic scene and records the movements associated with keyframes. The Copilot is *not* involved with creating Mandelbulb3D graphics. Therefore, you should have your Mandelbulb3D graphic designed the way you want it and have your Mandelbulb3D camera (view) positioned where you want to begin your animation keyframe sequence. The Copilot comes into play when you are ready to begin creating animation keyframes.

**Copilot Project Setup**

Assuming you are ready to capture keyframes, here at the steps for setting up a new animation project with the Copilot. Please refer to the numbers on the window screenshots below that correspond to the numbers of the following list.

1. Click the "New" button to create a new Copilot project (this is *not** creating a new Mandelbulb3D project).
2. Type in the name that you would like to give the project.
3. Type in (or click "Find") to enter the file location of the Mandelbulb3D mp3 (parameters) file. You can do this later if you prefer.
4. Type in (or click "Find") to enter the file location of the Mandelbulb3D m3a (animation) file. You can do this later if you prefer.
5. Type in a note about the project if you prefer. You can add or edit notes at any time.
6. Type in the value of the Far Plane. Get this value from the Mandlebulb3D Navigator window, lower left corner.
7. Type in the value of the Sliding/Walking Count. Get this value from the Mandlebulb3D Navigator window "Sliding+Walking step" entryfield.
8. Type in the value of the Looking/Rolling Angle. Get this value from the Mandlebulb3D Navigator window "Looking+Rolling Angle" entryfield.
9. Type in the value of the Frames Between. Get this value from the Mandlebulb3D Animation window "Subframes to render between" entryfield.
10. Click the "Update" button to update the Copilot's database with your project settings.

**Arranging Your Work Area**

Arrange the various windows so that the Copilot window is not covered by another window. Also arrange the Mandelbulb3D windows so that it's Navigator window is *not* covered. The Mandelbulb3D Main Editor window is not important to view while you are creating keyframes - that window can be covered or moved to a second monitor. If you have the screen space, position the Mandelbulb3D Animation window so that it's in view. Below is an example window layout.

**Creating Keyframes**

At this point you are ready to create keyframes using the Copilot. To do so, click the "Enable Capture" button or press the "Toggle Capture Mode" button on your game controller.

As you navigate through your Mandelbulb3D scene, click the "Make New Keyframe" ("A") button on your game controller to create a new keyframe when your move sequence for that keyframe is completed.

When done creating keyframes, or to take a rest, click the "Disable Capture" button or press the "Toggle Capture Mode" button on your game controller. Assuming that you make no changes to the Mandelbulb3D camera (view) position, you can resume keyframing your animation with the Copilot from where you left off.

**Copilot Demonstration Videos Available**

A series of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Mandelbulb3DTutorials" target="_blank">videos</a>  are published on YouTube that demonstrate using the Mandelbulb3D Animation Copilot. Video #15 demonstrates creating a 99 keyframe Mandelbulb3D sequence using the Copilot.

*Happy Keyframing!*
